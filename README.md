TODO:
- ~~Randomize ball color~~
- ~~Add slider for player to choose split probability~~
- ~~Implement custom random algorithm for 50/50 splits~~
- ~~Fix Canvas UI Scaling~~
- Bugfix: Some balls remain active on ResetSimulation
- Add accuracy stat to compare randomness to split chance
- Optimize for >1000 active balls
- ~~Build to WebGL~~

Nice-to-Haves:
- Add random tones on collision
- Further simulation customizability
    - Ball bounciness
    - Varying probabilities
    - Toggling ball-to-ball collision
    - Varying ball/border size
